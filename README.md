# What is this?
boojs was purpose built for FittrÂ® to provide information from our gocd server to our slack channel.  This is a standalone server that relays gocd information directly to slack.  **It is not a gocd plugin and relies on gocd's API for communication**.  Currently will monitor all pipelines for activity.
